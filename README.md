# SLUGGER (Formerly ALPB Analytics)
The first centralized data analytics platform for the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball, built to make cutting-edge baseball insights accessible across the league. Powered by Trackman radar data and developed in collaboration with the [Johns Hopkins University's Sports Analytics Research Group](https://sports-analytics.cs.jhu.edu/), SLUGGER enables analysts, players, coaches, and more to tap into a growing library of interactive “widgets” — analytical tools that use our API to drive game-changing insights.
